# BRACKET UNBUSTER

Bracket Unbuster is a tool that leverages machine learning (TensorFlow JS) to attempt to predict the final score of NCAA Tournament Games.  It uses historical end of year statistics and past tournament results to train the model.  The front end is build with React and Redux.  The backend is build with Node, Express, and MySQL.  This was my final individual week long project build for Project Shift Cohort 5.
